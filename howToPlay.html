<h1 class="titleText">HOW TO PLAY</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to Dewordle, this a program designed to test your knowledge on the Pokemon from the Unova region (the 5th iteration of games they made). The main objective of the game is to guess the mystery pokemon from this region in as few guesses as possible. The steps to playing the game are as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type in the search box a name of a generation 5 Pokemon and hit either the Enter or Guess button. (If you don&rsquo;t know any of the names, hit the Pokemon List button or use the autofill in the textbox to help with spelling.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guess will then display below the textbox and give you the information of the Entered Pokemon, telling you if you were right or wrong in the different characteristics of the Pokemon.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You keep taking guesses using the newly acquired information to make more educated guesses as to what Pokemon it might be.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Does This Information Mean?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you&rsquo;re probably wondering, &ldquo;Great, I have this information, but what does it mean?&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s time&nbsp; to learn a little bit about the characteristics of a Pokemon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evolution</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;&nbsp; This Category tells how many Pokemon are in that Pokemon&rsquo;s evolutionary line, which are the different pokemon it changes into. Pokemon such as Bisharp would have an evolution value of 2 because it evolves from Pawniard. Dewott Would have a value of 3 because it evolves from Oshawott and can evolve into Samurott.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;&nbsp; Types are like a Pokemon&rsquo;s way of having a complex game of rock, paper, scissors. One type can be better than others but also weak to other types. Dewott is a water type, meaning it could beat out the fire type Tepig, but would be weak to grass type pokemon like Snivy. Some Pokemon like the fire and bug type Volcarona can have two types at once. The types are just a way to specify groupings and similarities in different Pokemon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stats</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;&nbsp; Stats can be divided into 6 different types of attributes a Pokemon has;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hp</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;&nbsp; How bulky or how much health a Pokemon has.</span></p>
<p><strong>Atk</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;&nbsp; Attack, how much physical power a Pokemon has.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Def</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Defense, how much less damage a Pokemon takes from an attack</span></p>
<p><strong>Spa</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;&nbsp; Special Attack, How much mental damage a Pokemon can do.</span></p>
<p><strong>Spdef</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Special Defense, how much less damage a Pokemon takes from mental attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Spe</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Speed, or how fast a pokemon is compared to others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Pokemon can have a wide spread of numbers across its stats. Like a 30 Spe for a pokemon means it has a relatively low speed and moves fairly sluggishly. While a Pokemon with an Atk stat of 140 means it can pack quite a punch. Think of these stats as a unique spread that makes each Pokemon different and unique compared to other Pokemon.</span></p>
